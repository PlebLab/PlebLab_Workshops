# PlebLab_Workshops

Pleb Lab is a group of misfit hackers who firmly believe that coming together to support developers is key for bitcoin to continue on. Free and open-source development is critical to breakthroughs in bitcoin. The FOSS ethos is at the center of what we do here at Pleb Lab.

The following PlebLab_Workshops project is a place to find all the current workshops and upcoming workshops that will be done inside of ⚡️PlebLab. Located in Austin, Texas. 

If you would like to request a workshop please make an issue.
If you would like to do a workshop here at PlebLab make an issue and email: workshops@pleblab.com to have it scheduled. Please keep in mind we are a Bitcoin focused hacker space. We are open to tools and infastructure workshops devs would use. (Example: Revplit, Docker, Vercel etc..)
