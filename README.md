# 💻 PlebLab_Workshops

Pleb Lab is a group of misfit hackers who firmly believe that coming together to support developers is key for bitcoin to continue on. Free and open-source development is critical to breakthroughs in bitcoin. The FOSS ethos is at the center of what we do here at Pleb Lab.

The following PlebLab_Workshops project is a place to find all the current workshops and upcoming workshops that will be done inside of ⚡️PlebLab. Located in Austin, Texas.
